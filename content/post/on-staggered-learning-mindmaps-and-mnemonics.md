# Introduction

At the start of 2021, after a year of Covid-19 craziness, I found myself ready for a new challenge. Prior to the lockdowns, I had been on a good roll studying the Microsoft Azure Cloud, getting certified as a developer, solutions architect and finally (reaching my personal goal) as a DevOps expert. I felt that it would be of value for me to extend my knowledge by adding a second cloud (AWS) to the mix. I was not only interested in extending my technical skills but perhaps even more keen to try to discern over-arching principles and practices in infrastructure design and application development that were not bound to a single Cloud.

# How I used to Study

While working on my Azure certifications, I would follow what you might call a "classic" method of preparing for the tests. I would spend a lot of time with an online course (or two), consuming videos on all the topics required for the exam, and at some point when I felt ready I would start doing practice tests.

The way I used the practice tests is worth noting: as the questions on these tests usually provide a link to more information regarding the topic they cover, I would specifically spend my first attempt answering questions wrong and copying down all the "more information" links for review. This was my way of identifying and filling gaps in my knowledge.

Essentially this technique worked for me. However, while I generally passed the exams I took, I never really seemed to live up to my own expectations as far as the scores went. I had a feeling that, for the amount of time spent, I should be scoring higher. Or looking at it the other way around, I should be able to get these scores with less study time. I also started wondering if my passive approach to study (watching video and reading) was really the best tactic if my goal was not just to pass a test, but to really grasp the field I was studying. Often the materials I mastered for the tests seemed to be gone from my head in short order afterwards, so was I really getting all I could out of it?

Regardless, I was ready to dive into AWS at the start of 2021. I had a training coming up at CloudSkills on the Solutions Architect path and I wanted to get the Cloud Practitioner cert under my belt in preparation.

It just so happens I had picked up a couple of audiobooks in the months prior and I was finding more time again to listen to them - I was no longer spending time in the car due to the lockdown, so my backlog of audio-books and podcasts had been growing out of control - but I had started re-prioritizing my daily walks, so as they were becoming regular again I started bringing my headphones with me.

Specifically there are two books I "read" this way that I want to mention:

* "**Ultralearning**" by _Scott H. Young_, which chronicles the author's findings on what he calls meta-cognition or meta-learning from years spent on projects such as learning 4 languages in a year to a high level of competency, or passing the equivalent of an MIT Computer Sciences degree in one year.
* "**Make it Stick**" by _Peter C. Brown et.al._, an overview of recent discoveries in cognitive psychology and other disciplines, the last chapter adds a set of concrete techniques and tips for becoming more efficient learners/teachers.

I had also previously read and greatly enjoyed a number of _Cal Newport_'s books. **"Deep Work"** is a book which essentially sparked my interest in the topics of focus and deliberate study.

While reading and walking, I realized I could use this new set of certification exams as an opportunity to experiment with a different learning style, applying what I was learning, as I was learning it, and incorporating the advise and techniques the books promote.

# Disclaimer

I want to take special care at this time to make two points to you, the reader, about the contents of this article.

1. Learning about learning is an ongoing discovery for me. I am still refining my methods and tweaking my habits to improve, based on results studying for exams. Therefore I do not pretend to have a magic recipe for ultra-efficient study, nor do I strive to tell you what to do when tackling exams and how to do it. I am only documenting my own findings and sharing them hoping others can benefit.
2. I do not strive to spend the least amount of money possible on course materials in order to pass the exams. I still use online courses and preparation exams that often require me to pay. I have a PluralSight subscription and am a CloudSkills member and I regularly use paid preparation exam questions. While they are not essential, in my opinion they do offer benefits.

# What I learned about learning

In this section I will try to outline the main lessons I learned about studying efficiently. The first point I would like to make is this: there can be a big difference between knowing a subject and testing well on it.

Look at it this way: do you believe someone who can name all the European nations' capitals and can give you the start- and end-dates of all major conflicts, to be an expert on European history? No, right? Expertise requires a more intimate level of knowledge than trivia and dates, right?

I came to the conclusion that to be an expert Cloud Architect is not about being able to answer questions right, it's about being comfortable executing tasks in an environment, about comparing options given certain scenario's and about designing solution given the cloud services available. So how do we get there? Well, there here are some key points to keep in mind.

## Learning Should be Hard

standard studying methods, re-reading and highlighting texts, watching videos etc. can give you the feeling of knowing a set of materials just because you are becoming familiar with the text and the way they are presented.

Have you ever had the feeling while reading a new text during study that everything in it made perfect sense? That you really kind of already know this just because it's all perfectly logical? This is a trap. What you may actually be becoming familiar with is the wording of the text you are reading, the sentences, paragraphs, sections and headings, rather than the actual materials presented.

In order to avoid this, I have strived to become a more active learner.

## Retrieval is Key

The key to learning is the ability to quickly and accurately retrieve a piece of information from your memory. Whether it's remembering what the capital of Poland is, or listing the five pillars of the AWS Well Architected Framework and their key principles, you are trying to walk the neural pathways in your brain to bring the correct piece of information to the front.

Studies have shown that the act of successfully retrieving information will strengthen the neural pathway involved, making the next attempt at retrieval a little easier and faster, so learning in effect is like repeatedly traveling a road in your mind, transforming it from a shallow dirt track into an information super-highway racing through your brain.

The implication this has on study strategy is that simple repeated intake or information through your senses is not sufficient. There has to be an active component involved where you answer a question or solve a problem that involves the desired knowledge. Only through diving into your memory and rooting around for the answer will the path become more traveled. This means that simply reading and re-reading a text, or watching a video course, in itself is not enough. You should be actively traveling your memory pathways as often as needed to keep the information fresh, and start doing this as soon as possible.

## Testing Early

The way I used tests before was as a guideline for whether or not I was ready to sit an exam. I would cram and consume materials, and then only when I felt like I was almost ready would I start taking practice tests. The goal at that point was to check what I knew and to identify gaps that needed revision.

This has changed. Today when I start a study session on a topic the first thing I do is look for some test questions to answer. It does not have to be a full practice exam or a set of 50 questions. No, I want about 5 specific questions on the topic I am about to study.

![image alt >](/images/testing.png)

You might ask why. Well, I use the questions to trigger what you might call _conscious effort_ contemplating the materials. I may not have studied it yet, but trying to answer a question up front will force me to consider existing knowledge, tie in things I learned earlier and all together be more attentive of what is being asked. Instead of just coasting through some questions because I know the answer, I have to look at the ask more closely and try to piece together an answer.

I'll add that, if there are no ready-made questions available, I will try to come up with my own questions as soon as possible while studying. This not only gives me something to work with, but also ensures that I pick my own wording for the question so I don't fall into the trap we discussed earlier of mistaking recognition for knowledge.

## Staggered Learning

See if this sounds familiar: I have made a high level list of the table of contents of two online prep courses for the AWS Solutions Architect exam. They look roughly like this:

* IAM and S3
* EC2
* Databases on AWS
* Advanced IAM
* Route 53
* VPCs
* ...

And like this:

* Fundamentals : IAM and EC2
* HA and Scaling: ELB and ASG
* Storage: EBS and EFS
* Route 53
* S3
* ...

Each section is between 30 minutes and several hours in length. When starting one of these courses I assume I was not the exception when I would start at chapter 1, go through it completely, move on to chapter 2, then 3 and so on.. Generally speaking each section would consist of theory, perhaps followed by some labs, often finishing with a practice test to see if I remembered what I am supposed to learn. I would easily spend multiple hours this way studying one or maybe two subjects, in succession. This is illustrated in the table below.

![](/images/stacked-learning.png)

As it turns out, research has shown that organizing effort into short, varied bursts of study on a mix of subjects has a positive effect on retention. So instead of starting with topic A, spending a few hours on theory, labs, testing, and then moving on to topic B for more of the same, it has value to interleave subjects A, B, C more quickly. Starting perhaps with an early set of trigger questions on A, a short text, then a video on subject C followed by a lab on topic B. A path not unlike the one shown below.

Unfortunately this method of staggered learning does not intuitively feel like the best approach. While studying it can often feel like more effort is required and you're having a harder time in general. But remember, learning should be hard, so armed with a bit of background information, perhaps you can give it a try, breaking up your studies into short and varied activities.

Another aspect of staggered learning is overall study duration and spacing. Research has shown that spending one hour a day, every day is more effective than spending 8 hours on a Saturday with your nose in the books. So try to go for regular, shorter intervals rather than the big weekend cram.

## Mental Models and Mindmaps

Learning new materials is all about building your own mental model of how things work. You create a representation in your head of how you believe things are interconnected, how theory and practice fit together and how to execute certain tasks. Then, as you continue to gather knowledge, you either refine or challenge that internal model. This can mean adding details, re-ordering relations or completely tearing down certain sections in light of new information.

I discovered a great tool in this endeavor in the use of mind-mapping software, as it allows me to create a physical manifestation of (parts of) my mental models. Not only does this give me a new way of viewing this information in a structured way, it also forces me to "re-encode" the incoming information - be it auditive, visual or tactile - into a new form of representation that I control. This breaks me away from the formatting of the source materials and immediately gives me an opportunity for reflection.

![image alt <](/images/solutions-architect-associate-master.png) I believe so strongly in the value of mind-mapping, that I actually decided to share the mind-maps I am creating while studying for the AWS exams. So if you are interested in these, go have a look on [https://mindmaps.leanfield.io](https://mindmaps.leanfield.io "https://mindmaps.leanfield.io")

Mind you, while I do hope you will find value in these maps, I mainly share them as inspiration for you to create your own versions of these while studying. As I said, they are meant to represent _YOUR_ mental model, so go ahead and give it a go. There are a ton of options to help you create the maps, I used the online tool at [draw.io](draw.io "draw.io") to create mine.

## Mnemonics

I am sure many of my readers are familiar with mister _Roy G. Biv_. For those of you who are not native English speakers, I bet you might know one of his close relatives (like his Dutch cousin Rog). _ROY G BIV_ is a mnemonic for remembering the colors of a rainbow in order (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet).

A mnemonic, derived from the Ancient Greek word μνημονικός (mnēmonikos), meaning 'of memory' or 'relating to memory', is a device, tool or pattern designed to assist in remembering information. Mnemonics can range from simple words or phrases, over little rhymes to remember important dates in history or the number of days in each month, to entire virtual walks through an imagined space in your head filled with objects and people representing information, so-called memory palaces.

My advice is simple: use mnemonics where applicable. I use them whenever I can. As there are many types of mnemonics suitable for "encoding" different kinds of information, giving a complete overview here would take us way beyond the scope of this article. I will settle today for putting them on your radar as a great tool and encouraging you to do some research and to actively look for ways to use mnemonics to help you in your studies.

# Conclusion

Here we are, I believe I have covered the most important lessons I have learned about learning. So far my results have been pretty good. I passed a first exam with a score over 95% and am working on my goal of gaining the DevOps Professional AWS certification.

As I mentioned at the start of this article, my goal in writing was not to sell a perfect solution for learning, only to share my own ongoing journey and perhaps inspire other learners to view their continuous learning as an opportunity to try out new techniques and experiment. So best of luck to you all!
