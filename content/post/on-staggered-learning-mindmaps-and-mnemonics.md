# Introduction

At the start of 2021, after a year of Covid craziness, I found myself ready for a new challenge. Prior to the lockdowns, I had been on a good roll studying the Microsoft Azure Cloud, getting certified as a developer, solutions architect and finally (reaching my personal goal) as a DevOps expert. I felt that it would be of value for me to extend my knowledge by adding a second cloud (AWS) to the mix. I was not only interested in extending my technical skills but perhaps even more keen to try to discern over-arching principles and practices in infrastructure design and application development that were not bound to a single Cloud.

# How I used to Study

While working on my Azure certifications, I would follow what you might call a "classic" method of preparing for the tests. I would spend a lot of time with an online course (or two), consuming videos on all the topics required for the exam, and at some point when I felt ready I would start doing practice tests.

The way I used the practice tests is worth noting: as the questions on these tests usually provide a link to more information regarding the topic they cover, I would specifically spend my first attempt answering questions wrong and copying down all the "more information" links for review.

Essentially this technique worked for me. However, while I generally passed the exams I took, I never really seemed to live up to my own expectations as far as the scores went. I had a feeling that, for the amount of time spent, I should be scoring higher. Or looking at it the other way around, I should be able to get these scores with less study time. I also started wondering if my passive approach to study (watching video and reading) was really the best tactic if my goal was not just to pass a test, but to really understand the materials and the field I was studying. Often the materials I mastered for the tests seemed to be gone from my head in short order afterwards, so was I really getting all I could out of it?

Regardless, I was ready to dive into AWS at the start of 2021. I had a training coming up at CloudSkills in March on the Solutions Architect path and I wanted to get the Cloud Practitioner cert under my belt in preparation. 

It just so happens I had picked up a couple of audiobooks in the months prior and I was finding more time again to listen to them - I was no longer spending time in the car due to the lockdown (WFH, no more commute), so my backlog of audio-books and podcasts was growing out of control, but my daily walks were becoming longer again and I started bringing a pair of headsets with me.

Specifically two books I "read" in this way are worth mentioning

* "**Ultralearning**" by Scott H. Young, which chronicles the author's findings from years spent performing learning _feats_ such as learning 4 languages in a year to a high level of competency, or passing the equivalent of an MIT Computer Sciences degree in one year.
* "**Make it Stick**" by Peter C. Brown et.al., an overview of recent discoveries in cognitive psychology and other disciplines, coupled with a set of concrete techniques for becoming more efficient learners.

I had also previously read and greatly enjoyed Cal Newport's **"Deep Work"**, a book which essentially sparked my interest in the topic.

These books made me realise I could use this new set of certifications as an opportunity to experiment with a different learning style, applying what I was learning from the books, as I was learning it, and incorporating the advise and techniques they promote.

# Disclaimer

I want to take special care at this time to make two points to you, the reader, about the contents of this article.

1. Learning about learning is an ongoing discovery for me. I am still refining my methods and tweaking my habits to improve, based on results studying for exams. Therefore I do not pretend to have a magic recipe for ultra-efficient study, nor do I strive to tell you what to do when tackling exams and how to do it. I am only documenting my own findings and sharing them hoping others can benefit.
2. I do not strive to spend the least amount of money possible on course materials in order to pass the exams. I still use online courses and preparation exams that often require me to pay. I have a PluralSight subscription and am a CloudSkills member and I regularly use paid preparation exam questions. While they are not essential in my opinion, they do offer benefits.
