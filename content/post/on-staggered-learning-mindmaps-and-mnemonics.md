# Introduction

At the start of 2021, after a year of Covid-19 craziness, I found myself ready for a new challenge. Prior to the lockdowns, I had been on a good roll studying the Microsoft Azure Cloud, getting certified as a developer, solutions architect and finally (reaching my personal goal) as a DevOps expert. I felt that it would be of value for me to extend my knowledge by adding a second cloud (AWS) to the mix. I was not only interested in extending my technical skills but perhaps even more keen to try to discern over-arching principles and practices in infrastructure design and application development that were not bound to a single Cloud.

# How I used to Study

While working on my Azure certifications, I would follow what you might call a "classic" method of preparing for the tests. I would spend a lot of time with an online course (or two), consuming videos on all the topics required for the exam, and at some point when I felt ready I would start doing practice tests.

The way I used the practice tests is worth noting: as the questions on these tests usually provide a link to more information regarding the topic they cover, I would specifically spend my first attempt answering questions wrong and copying down all the "more information" links for review. This was my way of identifying and filling gaps in my knowledge.

Essentially this technique worked for me. However, while I generally passed the exams I took, I never really seemed to live up to my own expectations as far as the scores went. I had a feeling that, for the amount of time spent, I should be scoring higher. Or looking at it the other way around, I should be able to get these scores with less study time. I also started wondering if my passive approach to study (watching video and reading) was really the best tactic if my goal was not just to pass a test, but to really grasp the field I was studying. Often the materials I mastered for the tests seemed to be gone from my head in short order afterwards, so was I really getting all I could out of it?

Regardless, I was ready to dive into AWS at the start of 2021. I had a training coming up at CloudSkills on the Solutions Architect path and I wanted to get the Cloud Practitioner cert under my belt in preparation.

It just so happens I had picked up a couple of audiobooks in the months prior and I was finding more time again to listen to them - I was no longer spending time in the car due to the lockdown (WFH, no more commute), so my backlog of audio-books and podcasts had been growing out of control, but I had started re-prioritising my daily walks, so they were becoming longer again and I started bringing my headphones with me.

Specifically there are two books I "read" in this way that I want to mention:

* "**Ultralearning**" by Scott H. Young, which chronicles the author's findings on what he calls meta-cognition or meta-learning from years spent on projects such as learning 4 languages in a year to a high level of competency, or passing the equivalent of an MIT Computer Sciences degree in one year.
* "**Make it Stick**" by Peter C. Brown et.al., an overview of recent discoveries in cognitive psychology and other disciplines, the last chapter adds a set of concrete techniques and tips for becoming more efficient learners/teachers.

I had also previously read and greatly enjoyed a number of Cal Newport's books. **"Deep Work"** is a book which essentially sparked my interest in the topics of focus and deliberate study.

While reading and walking, I realised I could use this new set of certification exams I would prepare for as an opportunity to experiment with a different learning style, applying what I was learning, as I was learning it, and incorporating the advise and techniques the books promote.

# Disclaimer

I want to take special care at this time to make two points to you, the reader, about the contents of this article.

1. Learning about learning is an ongoing discovery for me. I am still refining my methods and tweaking my habits to improve, based on results studying for exams. Therefore I do not pretend to have a magic recipe for ultra-efficient study, nor do I strive to tell you what to do when tackling exams and how to do it. I am only documenting my own findings and sharing them hoping others can benefit.
2. I do not strive to spend the least amount of money possible on course materials in order to pass the exams. I still use online courses and preparation exams that often require me to pay. I have a PluralSight subscription and am a CloudSkills member and I regularly use paid preparation exam questions. While they are not essential, in my opinion they do offer benefits.

# What I learned about learning

## Learning Should be Hard

standard studying methods, re-reading and highlighting texts, watching videos etc can give you the feeling of knowing a set of materials just because you are becoming familiar with the text where they are presented.

Have you ever had the feeling while reading a new text during study that everything in it made perfect sense, and that you really kind of already know this just because it's all perfectly logical? this is a trap

## Testing Early

The way I used tests before was as a guideline for whether or not I was ready to take a test. As I mentioned earlier I would cram and consume materials, and then only when I felt like I was almost ready would I start taking practice tests. The goal at that point was to check what I knew and to identify gaps that needed revision.

This has changed. Today when I start a study session on a topic the first thing I do is look for some test questions to answer. It does not have to be a full practice exam or a set of 50 questions. No, I want about 5 specific questions on the topic I am about to study.

You might ask why. Well, I use the questions to trigger what I call "conscious effort" contemplating the materials. I may not have studied it yet, but trying to answer a question up front will force me to consider existing knowledge, tie in things I learned earlier and all together be more attentive of what is being asked. Instead of just coasting through some questions because I know the answer, I have to look at the ask more closely and try to piece together an answer.

I'll add that, if there are no ready-made questions available, I will try to come up with my own questions as soon as possible while studying. This not only gives me something to work with, but also ensures that I pick my own wording for the question so I don't fall into the trap of mistaking recognition for knowledge

## Mental Models and Mindmaps

Learning new materials is all about building your own mental model of how things work. You create a presentation in your head of how you believe things are interconnected, how theory and practice fit together and how to execute certain tasks. Then as you continue to gather knowledge you either refine or challenge that internal model, adding details, re-ordering relations or completely tearing down certain sections in light of new information.

I discovered a great tool in this endeavour in the use of mind-mapping software, as it allows me to create a physical manifestation of (parts of) my mental models. Not only does this give me a new way of viewing this information in a structured way, it also forces me to "re-encode" the incoming information, be it auditive, visual or tactile, into a new form of representation that I control. This breaks me away from the formatting of the source materials and immediately gives me an opportunity for reflection.

I believe so strongly in the value of mindmapping, that I actually decided to share the mindmaps I am creating while studying for the AWS exams here. So if you are interested in these, go have a look on [https://mindmaps.leanfield.io](https://mindmaps.leanfield.io "https://mindmaps.leanfield.io")

Mind you, while I do hope you will find value in these maps, I mainly share them as inspiration for you to create your own versions of these while studying. As I said, they are meant to represent YOUR mental model, so go ahead and have a go. I used the online tool at [draw.io](draw.io "draw.io")to create mine, but there are a ton of tools to help you here.
