title: Building an Azure Cognitive Search Results page in Vue.js (Part I)
excerpt: In this article we will build a similar appliciation using the Vue.js JavaScript
  Framework and the Vuex state management library. Doing so will not only result in
  a useful Vue application, it will also provide a context for exploring the Azure
  Search query API. The goal is to take small, logical steps working towards the final
  result to highlight the process as well as the code involved.
